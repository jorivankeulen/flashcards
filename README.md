# Flashcards Study App 

Welcome! 

My name is Jori and this is my third and final project for the Udacity React Nanodegree. 
For this project, I've created a small application through which you can study for your exam using decks of flashcards. Users can create and browse through card decks. To each deck users can add unlimited cards, each containing both a question and an answer.
In order to learn the cards, users can quiz themselves on the cards. Afterwards a user will receive a score and is able to take the quiz again.
Last but not least, if a user hasn't studied, it will be prompted the day after via a local notification.

To add a Deck, press `New Deck`
To add a Card, isit a deck and press `New Card` in the deck view
To take a quiz, visit a deck and press `Take Quiz`
